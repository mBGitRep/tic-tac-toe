## :page_facing_up: About
This project is all about making Tic Tac Toe as a web based programme. Its a game in which two players by turns put crosses and zeros in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of three crosses or three zeros before the opponent does.

- Feel free to review and update your plan as you go and according to the results you get while writing the code.
- Several attempts and redos are normal at the beginner stage.
