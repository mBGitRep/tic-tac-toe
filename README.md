This project 

## :page_facing_up: About

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- Talk about approach to the problem.
- Add screenshots/drawings of doodles/plans during the planning phase.


## :rocket: Cool tech
- HTML - structure the web page.
- CSS - style the web app using Grid, Flexbox and Animations.
- JavaScript - entire logic of the game.


## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Validating the input for player's name.
- Buttons to not click too many times (cause its broken :unamused:)

## :sob: Lessons learnt
I might consider re-writing conditional statement in an optimal and shorter way.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
I would probably add restart game function with the score board for each player.
